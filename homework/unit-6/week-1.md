# Meme Studio

### Project overview

The purpose of this project is to create an Android app to add captions onto an image. Each team member should implement functionality to create at least one type of meme. Some example types of memes this app could support:

- Vanilla memes: an image with [text overlaid on the top/middle/bottom](https://i0.wp.com/www.developermemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Now-That-You-Have-That-Feature-Done-I-Want-It-To-Do-Something-Else-Instead-Web-Developer-Meme.jpg?resize=385%2C232) (or any combination of those three).
- De-motivational posters: an [image with a black border, and a caption that includes larger text followed by smaller text](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/6917/products/underachievementpenguindemotivator.jpeg?v=1414017096).
- Doge memes: [a picture is worth a thousand words](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/609/380/98b.jpg).
- Theory / Actual meme: choose two images and [compare them](http://www.funnymeme.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dog-memes-multithreaded-programming.jpg).
- Allow the user to draw freely on the image, [MS Paint style](http://www.wikihow.com/images/a/af/Draw-a-Sprite-(Microsoft-Paint)-Step-6.jpg).

Users should be able to:

- Choose an image from the device's photo gallery to create a meme.
- Save a meme to the device's photo gallery.
- Share the meme using other social apps (such as Hangouts, Slack or Twitter).

A secondary purpose of this project is to get better at team project workflow and collaboration in preparation for your final portfolio projects. Each team member will complete a [Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/HgQvPiyR6esh1ePt2) to share peer feedback for the teamwork component of this project. Your peers (and yourself) will be asked to evaluate you on:

- Did you meet deadlines in a timely manner and contribute a fair share to the project?
- Were you present at and actively participating in team meetings?
- Did you exhibit good research abilities and were you capable of working well independently?
- Did you collaborate well with other team members and work well with the team in debugging, distributing responsibilities and problem solving.

### Requirements

* The app should should allow the user to access images from the device's photo gallery -- this isn't something we've covered in class, so it will require independent research!
* Save the completed meme to device storage. Reading / writing from storage should happen on a background thread.
* Use an implicit intent to share the meme to other apps.
* There should be a consistent look and feel across the entire app. 
* The app should look great in both landscape and portrait modes.
* The app should not crash or hang during normal use.
* The code should be semantically clean, well organized and adhere to the Google Code Style Guide.
* Each team must use a Trello board to plan and track work on this project. Please submit a link to your team's Trello board by the end of class today using the meeting form below.

### Bonus features
* Take a picture (i.e. open the camera) from within the app.
* Allow user to choose from different fonts and text colors.
* Implement your own custom or composite views.
* Research Material Design and create a beautiful, consistent UI that adheres to Material principles.
* Integrate a web API of your choice.
* Moar meme types!

### Submission

Students will work **in teams** to complete this project over the next **two weeks**. All code should be completed, pushed and merged by **Saturday 01/21 at 9pm**. Check Slack for the submission form link.

### Meeting Agenda

* Review project requirements as a team.
* Nominate a tech lead - preference goes to members who haven't served yet as leads on their previous teams.
* Define what meme type each team member will be implementing, how each feature will be separated/integrated, and any other details relevant to the features you're completing.
* Create a project Trello board using the [AC 3.3 Sprint Template](https://trello.com/b/pz8oJNK2/ac-3-3-sprint-template). Make sure both team members have edit access to the board and that the visibility is set to 'Public'.
* Discuss and decide on feature cards for the project and add them to the Trello board backlog. Give each feature a priority and an estimate and rank them by priority in the backlog.
* Assign each feature to a team member. Refer to the estimation values to balance features equally across the team, keeping priorities, blockers and related tasks in mind.
* Decide when and where your team will meet throughout the week for in-person working sessions and pair programming.
* Decide on a time for a daily (Sat - Weds) stand-up, and decide whether the stand-up will be held in person or on Slack.
* Create a team Slack channel.
* Create a Github repo and add all team members as collaborators.
* Create a new Android Studio project and push it to the repo.
* Use any additional time to start researching and/or implementing features.
* [Submit your meeting notes and a link to your Trello board and Github repo by the end of class today](https://goo.gl/forms/axiF0IdMPt0sESDJ3).
