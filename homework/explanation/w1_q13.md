### Problem Solving

I'm going to use Q13 because I'm biased and I'm a fan of Uber ice cream for many reasons. Here is an entire step by step walk through of how I would solve this problem and my mindset the entire way. This should serve as a template for how you might want to tackle a problem. 

I'm also going to try and go above and beyond, so even students who have been keeping up this entire time will surely learn something new.

### Q13. scanner-ice-cream-start-up ([problem repeated verbatim from week-1](https://github.com/C4Q/AC3.3/blob/master/homework/week-1.md))

Your friends just came up with a great new start-up idea: it's like Uber for ice cream! They've asked you to write a prototype Java program that will accept ice cream orders for delivery.  The program should use a Scanner object to read user input and should:

1. Greet the user and ask them for a **name**.
2. Ask the user what **flavor** of ice cream they would like.
3. One-by-one, offer three **toppings** of your choice which the user will select by inputting 'yes'.
4. Calculate the total **price** of the order: the base ice cream costs $2.33 and each topping is an additional $0.33 cents.
5. Calculate a **delivery wait time** estimate, which should be a random number of minutes between 1 and 60.
6. Print an **order confirmation** to the console that contains the following details: the user's name, ice cream flavor, number of toppings, total price, and delivery wait time.

Here is an example interaction:
```
Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?
> Jim
Okay Jim, which flavor of ice cream would you like?
> vanilla
Would you like chocolate chips?
> yes
Would you like bananas?
> No
Would you like gummy bears?
> YES
Okay! A vanilla ice cream with 2 toppings. Your total is $2.99 and your ice cream will arrive in 12 minutes.
```

I actually just skimmed the problem. There's a lot of text. 

What I picked up was:

- Scanner object. I need to use Scanner to read user input, somehow.
- I have an example of what the output looks like in the code block above. I'm used to entering things in console, so I know every time I see `>`, it means the user is going to type something and hit enter. I need to use Scanner to grab the user input during those times.
- It's related to ice cream.

Cool. I'm going to start with a clean class file and name it `IceCreamService` instead of the usual `Main`:

```java
public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

  }
}
```

**I run this to make sure it compiles and runs.** It does. I'm happy. Write small pieces of code and make sure things run every step of the way. You don't try to build the house all in one shot--you do it brick by brick. This is my first brick--making sure I wrote `public static void main` correctly.

Now I want to make sure I can read user input correctly. The problem told me **`The program should use a Scanner object to read user input`**. So let's just make sure when I write a Scanner, I can do it correctly:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    scanner.next();
  }
}
```

IntelliJ does some handy things when I type Scanner and will import when I need to. If you're missing any imports, usually a prompt will show up and tell you to hit `Option + Enter` (Alt + Enter on Windows). I run this and make sure it compiles with no error. I check the console and see it didn't say `Process finished with exit code 0`. That means it's waiting for me to type something into console. I do, and verify the code exited:

```
// console output:
sdf

Process finished with exit code 0
```

So now I know I can properly read the next String from console input. If I didn't know how to make Scanner read user input, I would have Googled ["java how to read user input"](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=java+how+to+read+user+input) and the first Stack Overflow link basically explains what I needed. In fact, the only reason I didn't need to Google it now was because I Googled it last week (that link was purple for me) and helping you guys with these problems I've been using Scanners over and over again. I don't use Scanner in real life (sorry).

Back to the problem--regardless of all the math and the toppings, just from the example code snippet alone, I see that I ask for the user input 5 times. So lets do that:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    scanner.next();
    scanner.next();
    scanner.next();
    scanner.next();
    scanner.next();
  }
}
```

And I run this and verify console requires me to type five things before I get the `exit code 0` which tells me the code is finished:

```
// console
One
Two
Three
Four
Five

Process finished with exit code 0
```

I have the skeleton/backbone of the program ready. I know I'm going to ask for user input 5 times, I just need to add all the prompts inbetween. Let's copy and paste all the Strings in the app and print them before each `scanner.next()` call.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.println("Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.println("Okay Jim, which flavor of ice cream would you like?");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.println("Would you like chocolate chips?");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.println("Would you like bananas?");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.println("Would you like gummy bears?");
    scanner.next();
  }
}
```

I run this. I start to see things in console, which is a good thing, and start entering user input. **I'm confident the user input part works, because I just verified that it worked before and all I added inbetween was a bunch of print statements.**

```
// console
Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?
Erick
Okay Jim, which flavor of ice cream would you like?
chocolate
Would you like chocolate chips?
yes
Would you like bananas?
no
Would you like gummy bears?
yes

Process finished with exit code 0
```

I tweak the prompts because I see the example snippet wants my user input to lead with `>`. Easy enough: add a new line, insert angle bracket. **I still run the code anyway, because I want to make sure my "simple" change didn't break anything. Just in case.** As I walk around as a TA, I see many of you make "simple" compile error mistakes that I catch right away because I'm used to spotting these things, but you guys aren't running your code nearly enough between steps. You forget to close a curly brace here or missing a quotation line there, or forget a semicolon, etc. You don't want to be 20 levels deep into the problem fishing for these needle-in-a-haystack problems. If your code works now and you make a small change which breaks, it's easy to notice what you did that broke it.

Run your code more often. Make sure it works every step of the way.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.println("Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?\n>");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.println("Okay Jim, which flavor of ice cream would you like?\n>");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.println("Would you like chocolate chips?\n>");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.println("Would you like bananas?\n>");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.println("Would you like gummy bears?\n>");
    scanner.next();
  }
}
```

I run this and notice I'm printing an extra line after `>` which I don't want. Cool: I know I just need to switch to `System.out.print` instead of `println`. It's a minor thing since it doesn't stop my code from working in the end, but I like to be complete.

I run it again and verify it looks as intended. It actually doesn't: The output has the angle bracket too close to my input.

```
// console
Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?
>sdf
```

I add a space, **run it again**, and verify everything looks as expected:
```
Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?
> Erick
Okay Jim, which flavor of ice cream would you like?
> chocolate
Would you like chocolate chips?
> yes
Would you like bananas?
> no
Would you like gummy bears?
> yes

Process finished with exit code 0
```

Wonderful. So now my program *looks* right, but obviously it isn't. For starters, it asked me for my name, I said Erick, and it called me Jim. So how do I reuse the input I got from the user to replace where my code called me Jim?

I need to save the user input as a String. I then do some simple String concatenation to cut Jim out of the picture and put myself in there instead.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.print("Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?\n> ");
    String name = scanner.next(); // Let's save user input as the name
    System.out.print("Okay " + name + ", which flavor of ice cream would you like?\n> "); // Let's spit the name back out
    scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like chocolate chips?\n> ");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like bananas?\n> ");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like gummy bears?\n> ");
    scanner.next();
  }
}
```

I **run this and verify I get what I expect**. 

```
Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?
> Erick
Okay Erick, which flavor of ice cream would you like?
> 
```

I see my name, I'm happy. We've finished the first input of the problem.

I see in the problem statement, the second requirement is to save the flavor. Since we're not limiting ourselves to specific flavors, whatever the user inputs is going to be the flavor. We need to save it because the last output in the problem statement says `Okay! A vanilla ice cream with 2 toppings. Your total is $2.99 and your ice cream will arrive in 12 minutes.` which repeated the `vanilla` part that was passed in as the input.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.print("Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?\n> ");
    String name = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Okay " + name + ", which flavor of ice cream would you like?\n> ");
    String flavor = scanner.next(); // We're saving the flavor so we can print it later
    System.out.print("Would you like chocolate chips?\n> ");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like bananas?\n> ");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like gummy bears?\n> ");
    scanner.next();
  }
}
```

We run the code and verify it compiles and works as expected up until this point. We're not doing anything with our new `flavor` yet.

We see the next 3 questions are just `yes`/`no` questions. And it's worth seeing that the inputs were a mix of lowercase (yes), capitalized first word (No) and all caps (YES). Since we are okay with rude customers, `yes` should be treated the same as `YES`. This suggests we should either convert the user input to all lowercase or all capital before checking whether they said yes or no. Otherwise `"yes".equals("Yes"); // returns false`, which we don't want.

So our program is **asking for 3 toppings, and we need to know how many toppings**. Note that we aren't asked to spit back the exact toppings they said yes/no to, just **how many**. And the idea of **how many** means we probably just need to **count** how many times the user said yes. So let's create a `count` variable, where we increase the counter by 1 every time the user says `yes`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    int numToppings = 0; // added my counter

    System.out.print("Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?\n> ");
    String name = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Okay " + name + ", which flavor of ice cream would you like?\n> ");
    String flavor = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like chocolate chips?\n> ");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like bananas?\n> ");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like gummy bears?\n> ");
    scanner.next();

    System.out.println("Num Toppings: " + numToppings); // Print num toppings, just for developing the yes/no part
  }
}
```

I add my counter and I add another print statement to print out what `numToppings` is equal to, so while I'm building out this feature where I count how many times the user says yes, I can test a few different scenarios and make sure `numToppings` is the right value.

My output when I run it:

```
Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?
> Erick
Okay Erick, which flavor of ice cream would you like?
> purple
Would you like chocolate chips?
> yes
Would you like bananas?
> no
Would you like gummy bears?
> yes
Num Toppings: 0

Process finished with exit code 0
```

So now I'm ready to add the part where I check if user said `yes` or `no` and increase `numToppings` if it's yes. My strategy is:
- Read the user input
- Convert it to lowercase
- Check if it `equals("yes")`. If so, increase `numToppings` by one.

So I do it, just for the first topping: there's no rush to try and do all 3 toppings right away. If it will work for the first topping, it will work for them all. If it breaks for the first topping, it will break for them all.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    int numToppings = 0;

    System.out.print("Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?\n> ");
    String name = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Okay " + name + ", which flavor of ice cream would you like?\n> ");
    String flavor = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like chocolate chips?\n> ");
    String hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
    }
    System.out.print("Would you like bananas?\n> ");
    scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like gummy bears?\n> ");
    scanner.next();

    System.out.println("Num Toppings: " + numToppings);
  }
}
```

I phrase it `hasTopping` because generally yes/no questions or `boolean`-like things should be named/phrased in the form of a "is"/"has" state. This makes it easier for me to read out loud, because it sounds like `"if hasTopping [to lowercase] is equal to "yes" then increase numToppings by one"`

I run this and confirm if I type "yes", `Num Toppings: 1` prints out:

```
// console
Would you like chocolate chips?
> yes
...
Num Toppings: 1
```

I run it again and verify with "No" and "YES" that I get `Num Toppings: 0` and `Num Toppings: 1` respectively. 

**Now that I'm confident I can count 1 topping correctly, I repeat the same logic for the other 2 toppings**. I run it, and verify that `NumToppings` always prints out the right number of toppings, as I mix and match capital and lowercase responses for yes and no.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    int numToppings = 0;

    System.out.print("Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?\n> ");
    String name = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Okay " + name + ", which flavor of ice cream would you like?\n> ");
    String flavor = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like chocolate chips?\n> ");
    String hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
    }
    System.out.print("Would you like bananas?\n> ");
    hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
    }
    System.out.print("Would you like gummy bears?\n> ");
    hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
    }

    System.out.println("Num Toppings: " + numToppings);
  }
}
```

Output:

```
// console
Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?
> Erick
Okay Erick, which flavor of ice cream would you like?
> chocolate
Would you like chocolate chips?
> yes
Would you like bananas?
> NO
Would you like gummy bears?
> YES
Num Toppings: 2

Process finished with exit code 0
```

I'm almost done. I can get rid of the `Num Toppings` line since now I'm fairly sure `numToppings` always gives me the right value, and add in the final copy instead which combines our `name`, `flavor`, and `numToppings`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    int numToppings = 0;

    System.out.print("Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?\n> ");
    String name = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Okay " + name + ", which flavor of ice cream would you like?\n> ");
    String flavor = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like chocolate chips?\n> ");
    String hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
    }
    System.out.print("Would you like bananas?\n> ");
    hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
    }
    System.out.print("Would you like gummy bears?\n> ");
    hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
    }

    System.out.println("Okay! A " + flavor + " ice cream with " + numToppings + " toppings. Your total is $2.99 and your ice cream will arrive in 12 minutes.");
  }
}
```

I notice I'm missing something though: the problem asked me to calculate cost of toppings and give me a random time in minutes.

Nonetheless, I run it and verify that the parts I have working actually work, which should be everything except for the cost (which is hard coded right now) and the time (also hard coded):

```
// console
Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?
> Erick
Okay Erick, which flavor of ice cream would you like?
> chocolate
Would you like chocolate chips?
> yes
Would you like bananas?
> no
Would you like gummy bears?
> YES
Okay! A chocolate ice cream with 2 toppings. Your total is $2.99 and your ice cream will arrive in 12 minutes.

Process finished with exit code 0
```

The problem says `ice cream` is $2.33 and it's `$0.33` more per topping. I add a field to keep track of ice cream cost, starting at 233 cents:

I update my output String to use `totalCost`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    int numToppings = 0;
    int totalCost = 233; // cents

    System.out.print("Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?\n> ");
    String name = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Okay " + name + ", which flavor of ice cream would you like?\n> ");
    String flavor = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like chocolate chips?\n> ");
    String hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
    }
    System.out.print("Would you like bananas?\n> ");
    hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
    }
    System.out.print("Would you like gummy bears?\n> ");
    hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
    }

    System.out.println("Okay! A " + flavor + " ice cream with " + numToppings + " toppings. Your total is $" + totalCost + " and your ice cream will arrive in 12 minutes.");
  }
}
```

Which naturally tells me my total is `$233` because right now I'm storing everything in cents. You could do the problem with `double totalCost = 2.33d` but I know better than to do math with money using non-precise floating point numbers. It wouldn't make that much of a difference to solving this problem, though.

So now we need a way to add `33 cents` to `totalCost` every time we have a topping. When do we know we're adding a topping? At the part where we increase `numTopping` by 1! So every time that happens, let's also increase `totalCost` by 33 cents:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    int numToppings = 0;
    int totalCost = 233; // cents

    System.out.print("Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?\n> ");
    String name = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Okay " + name + ", which flavor of ice cream would you like?\n> ");
    String flavor = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like chocolate chips?\n> ");
    String hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
      totalCost = totalCost + 33;
    }
    System.out.print("Would you like bananas?\n> ");
    hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
      totalCost = totalCost + 33;
    }
    System.out.print("Would you like gummy bears?\n> ");
    hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
      totalCost = totalCost + 33;
    }

    System.out.println("Okay! A " + flavor + " ice cream with " + numToppings + " toppings. Your total is $" + totalCost + " and your ice cream will arrive in 12 minutes.");
  }
}
```

And run and verify:

```
//console
Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?
> Erick
Okay Erick, which flavor of ice cream would you like?
> chocolate
Would you like chocolate chips?
> yes
Would you like bananas?
> no
Would you like gummy bears?
> YES
Okay! A chocolate ice cream with 2 toppings. Your total is $299 and your ice cream will arrive in 12 minutes.

Process finished with exit code 0
```

Yes! We get `299`, which is what we are looking for. To convert our 299 to `2.99`, we just divide by `100d` while we print:

```
System.out.println("Okay! A " + flavor + " ice cream with " + numToppings + " toppings. Your total is $" + totalCost/100d + " and your ice cream will arrive in 12 minutes.");
```

And now our output looks like:
```
// console
Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?
> Erick
Okay Erick, which flavor of ice cream would you like?
> chocolate
Would you like chocolate chips?
> yes
Would you like bananas?
> No
Would you like gummy bears?
> YES
Okay! A chocolate ice cream with 2 toppings. Your total is $2.99 and your ice cream will arrive in 12 minutes.

Process finished with exit code 0
```

Awesome--the total cost is correct. Now we just need to add in the minutes.

I [google "java random"](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=java%20random) and see a promising Stack Overflow post called ["Getting random numbers in java"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5887709/getting-random-numbers-in-java) which is what I'm looking for. In that link there's this wonderful snippet marked as the correct answer:

```java
Random rand = new Random();

int  n = rand.nextInt(50) + 1;
//50 is the maximum and the 1 is our minimum 
```

Cool--our problem says we want a number from 1 to 60, so it should look pretty close to that snippet:

```java
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IceCreamService {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    int numToppings = 0;
    int totalCost = 233; // cents

    System.out.print("Welcome to our ice cream service! What's your name?\n> ");
    String name = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Okay " + name + ", which flavor of ice cream would you like?\n> ");
    String flavor = scanner.next();
    System.out.print("Would you like chocolate chips?\n> ");
    String hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
      totalCost = totalCost + 33;
    }
    System.out.print("Would you like bananas?\n> ");
    hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
      totalCost = totalCost + 33;
    }
    System.out.print("Would you like gummy bears?\n> ");
    hasTopping = scanner.next();
    if (hasTopping.toLowerCase().equals("yes")) {
      numToppings = numToppings + 1;
      totalCost = totalCost + 33;
    }

    Random rand = new Random(); // added this
    System.out.println("Okay! A "
        + flavor
        + " ice cream with "
        + numToppings
        + " toppings. Your total is $"
        + totalCost / 100d
        + " and your ice cream will arrive in "
        + (rand.nextInt(60) + 1) // added this and broke up the String so it's easier to read
        + " minutes.");
  }
}
```

**This completes the problem**. I run this and get an output:

We see that a) we repeat the name back, b) we save the flavor name and repeat it back in the final string, c) we properly handle different capitalization of yes/no, d) we calculate how much the ice cream is correctly, and e) we show a random time from 1-60 minutes.
