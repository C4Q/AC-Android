# Open-ended Android App

### Project overview

In this project, you'll be creating an Android App of your own design and choosing. This is a chance to have some fun and practice the Android skills that you've learned so far.

### Basic Requirements
* Must be a Java-based Android App.
* Must not crash during demo.
* Save and restore instance state.
* Handle configuration changes and activity lifecycle.

### Feature Requirements
* Have at least **two different layouts**: a portrait when the phone is vertical and landscape when the phone is horizontal.
* Include at least **two Activities** with an **Intent** that launches the second Activity.
* Include at least **one Fragment**.
* Include at least **one RecyclerView** that displays data from a list.

### Some ideas if you're feeling stuck:

- Create a personalized "resume" app for yourself.
- Create a quiz or survey app that asks the user some questions and displays a result.
- Port your text-based adventure game to Android. Create Buttons to accept user input and ImageViews to illustrate your game.
- Choose a favorite app and try to create a simplified "MVP" clone of it.
- Search the Google Play Store for ideas!

### Submission

Students will work **individually** to complete this project over the next week. All code should be completed, pushed and merged by **10/29 at 9pm**. Check Slack for the submission form link.
