# Homework Unit 3 / Week 1

**1)** If you haven't already, read **Chapter 1** of *The Pragmatic Programmer*.

**2)** Choose one project that you completed during Unit 2: Memory Game or Scientific Calculator. Identify **three** small features and/or bug fixes that you would like to work on. 

Create a new branch for each task and complete the work then open a pull request. You do not need to merge, but may do so if your team approves the PR. Provide a link to each PR on the HW submission form.

**3)** Complete project planning for next week's assignment: your first [Open-ended Android App](week-2.md). Please read through the project requirements, then:

- Once you have decided on an app idea, write a short (1 or 2 paragraph) summary of the app idea.
- Create at least **5** [user stories](http://codesqueeze.com/the-easy-way-to-writing-good-user-stories/) for your app.
- Draw at least **2** [wireframes](https://developer.android.com/training/design-navigation/wireframing.html#wireframe) for your app. You can use an [online tool](https://wireframe.cc/), or if you prefer, just pencil and paper (take a photo of the drawing to submit).
- Create a list of specific [features](// TODO add link) for your app. Create a new project board on Trello by copying the [AC3.3 Project Template](//TODO add link). Add each feature as a card to the project backlog. Give each card an **estimate** and a **priority**, then arrange the cards by priority with the highest priority features at the top of the project backlog.
