# Now Feed

### Project overview

The purpose of this project is to create a [Google Now](https://www.google.com/search/about/features/05/) style feed. Each item in the feed is a card. The user can scroll through the feed of cards or interact with cards.

### Requirements
* The app must have at least one Activity -- more if it makes sense. The activity should include a list of interactive cards implemented with Android’s [RecyclerView and CardView](https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html) APIs.
* The app should include at least three types of cards: 
    * One card should present data that is stored and updated on the user’s phone using Shared Preferences (e.g. To-do card, Reminder card).
    * Two cards should present data provided through a web API (e.g. Weather card, Twitter card, Maps card, Photo of the Day). Check out http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory for API ideas! ***Each team member should be responsible for implementing one of these cards!***
* Use [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to handle HTTP requests and parse JSON data using the Gson converter.
* The app should look great in both landscape and portrait modes.
* The app should not crash or hang and should handle for when networking/internet is slow or unavailable.
* The code should be semantically clean and well organized.
* Each team must use a Trello board to plan and track work on this project. Please submit a link to your team's Trello board by the end of class today using the meeting form below.

### Bonus features
* Implement swipe to dismiss.
* Implement pull to refresh.
* Implement infinite scrolling.

### Submission

Students will work **in teams** to complete this project over the next **two weeks**. All code should be completed, pushed and merged by **Saturday 11/12 at 9pm**. Check Slack for the submission form link.


### Meeting Agenda

* Review project requirements as a team.
* Nominate a tech lead - preference goes to members who haven't served yet as leads on their previous teams.
* Define what each of your three Now cards will be (e.g. what information will the card display? If it uses a web API, which one? Which team member will be responsible for completing the card?)
* Create a project Trello board using the [AC 3.3 Sprint Template](https://trello.com/b/pz8oJNK2/ac-3-3-sprint-template). Make sure both team members have edit access to the board and that the visibility is set to 'Public'.
* Discuss and decide on feature cards for the project and add them to the Trello board backlog. Give each feature a priority and an estimate and rank them by priority in the backlog.
* Assign each feature to a team member. Refer to the estimation values to balance features equally across the team, keeping priorities, blockers and related tasks in mind.
* Decide when and where your team will meet throughout the week for in-person working sessions and pair programming.
* Decide on a time for a daily (Sat - Weds) stand-up, and decide whether the stand-up will be held in person or on Slack.
* Create a team Slack channel.
* Create a Github repo and add all team members as collaborators.
* Create a new Android Studio project and push it to the repo.
* [Submit your meeting notes and a link to your Trello board and Github repo by the end of class today](https://goo.gl/forms/xujBMv9OCAqbnF9K2).
