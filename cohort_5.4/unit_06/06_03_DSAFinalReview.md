# DS&A Review

## Warm-Up - DO THIS NOW :fire::fire::fire: !!! (20 Minutes)

Please attempt the following recursive coding challenges from Coding Bat:
* [Factorial](https://codingbat.com/prob/p154669)
* [Bunny Ears](https://codingbat.com/prob/p183649)
* [Fibonacci](https://codingbat.com/prob/p120015)

For each of these, please identify:
* The base case(s)
* The the reduction step(s) which will bring you to the base case

# Lecture

To prepare for DS&A Coding Challenges, it will be important to identify which data structures to use based of which problems are described. Please answer the following, and be prepared to implement an algorithm with the data structures selected:

1. You are asked to build a vending machine in Java. What data structure could best be used to keep track of inserting snacks, and removing them once they have been selected?

2. You are asked to track a hierarchy of elements, for example, views and view groups within an application. What data structure could be used to track these views and view groups?

3. You are asked to organize a retirement protocol for an HR department. What data structure could you use to identify which employees are ready to receive retirement benefits?

4. You are asked by a canvassing group to check how many unique classic cars there are per zip code. The actual count of these cars will be irrelevant, as they are more concerned with the diversity, rather than the frequency. Which data structure might you use to collect this information?

5. You are asked to create a contact list of game users, and their email addresses - which data structure would make sense to use, and why?

6. You are commissioned to collect votes for a class movie night - how would you tally these votes, and which data structure would you use?

7. You are asked to keep a list of holiday gifts for each member of your family. Each family member will receive the same count of holiday gifts every year - the only thing that will change is the gift itself. Which data structure would you use, and why?

8. You are asked to keep a shopping list within an app for groceries - that list can have items added or removed at anytime, and can even be empty! Which data structure would you use to track these items, and why?

9. You are asked to make a music playlist app, where users can add to the list, but while songs are playing, users can also select which song will play after the current one. Which data structure would you use to track which songs play next, and why?

10. You are asked to create an app that can check for when fellows finish making all of their Pursuit Bond Payments based on when they start their first job. Which data structure would you use to send their congratulation letters for their final payment, and why?
