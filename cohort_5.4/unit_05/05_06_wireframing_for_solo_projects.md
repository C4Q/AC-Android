# Lecture

In just a few days, you'll be asked to begin the process of building an Android Application that you will be expected to push up to the Google Play store to be downloaded by others.

When designing your own app, especially when following the design thinking principles described in the lesson on Ideation, it's important to build a prototype for how you'd expect your app to run.

However, before we write a single line of code, we should first visualize how we expect the app to appear using wireframes.

### What are Wireframes?

Wireframes are - simply put - a way to organize the views of your application, as you'd expect a user to see them on the screen, for each Activity/Fragment displayed. They are useful for several reasons:

1. They can help you visually describe which views you'd like to use
2. They can help you visually describe how you would like these views to be arranged
3. They can help you visually organize the flow of execution based on particular user interactions
4. They can help you visually catalog the number of pages your app is expected to display in order to reach "minimum viable product"

### How can you make a Wireframe

In the paraphrased words of Walt Disney - "If you can draw it, you can do it!"

The simplist way to produce a wireframe, is to simply illustrate how you'd like your app to appear using a whiteboard and marker, a pencil and paper - anything that would allow you to easily draw your wireframes. Journals with guides, such as graph paper or bullet journals, can be a great and affordable way to visualize how you'd like your app to look before creating it.
