# Lecture

Based on feedback fair responses from fellows, we will practice, as a class, completing coding questions on the whiteboard.

A fellow will be selected at random, to complete a question on the board, while remembering to communicate their thought process to their interviewer (instructor).

Each fellow will have a half-hour to complete a given question. If the fellow completes the question within the time alloted, they may be asked to optomize their algorithm. This is completely normal, and expected in the interview process. Be willing to first provide a brute-force solution, then be prepared to refactor the algorithm, to make it either more elegant, or efficient, if necessary.

Three (3) fellows will be randomly selected within a two (2) period. Please select from one of the following:

### Pairs:

``` java
Given an array of non-empty strings, create and return a Map<String, String> as follows: for each string add its first character as a key with its last character as the value.

pairs(["code", "bug"]) → {"b": "g", "c": "e"}
pairs(["man", "moon", "main"]) → {"m": "n"}
pairs(["man", "moon", "good", "night"]) → {"g": "d", "m": "n", "n": "t"}
```
