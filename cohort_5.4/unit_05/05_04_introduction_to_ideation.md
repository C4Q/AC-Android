# Lecture

Android applications, as you've seen over the past 7 months, are not that hard to make - truly. Yes, clean code is important, core readability is invaluable, and the speed of your algorithms and libraries you use can make the difference between a frequently used app, and a frequently uninstalled one.

However, well-made apps just don't pop up out of thin air. They involve planning, understanding the possible users of your app, and contemplating possible solutions. In essence, they require ideation.

### "Sharpening the Saw"

Dr. Steven Covey, the author of "7 Habits of Highly Effective People", describes this quote as the foundation behind his 7th effective habit:

```
Give me 8 hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first 6 in sharpening the axe (saw).
```

You'll find that with proper preparation, you'll not only be able to successfully complete assessments and coding challenges, you'll also be able to create great ideas for your own apps!

This unit, Unit 05, wil culminate in the completion of a personal solo project you'll be expected to eventually submit to the Google Play store. This means you'll have to spend a considerable amount time on your own coming up with ideas, fleshing them out, then turning them into an actual Android Application.

### What is Ideation?

Ideation is a creative process where designers generate ideas in sessions (e.g., brainstorming, worst possible idea). It is the third stage in the Design Thinking process. Participants gather with open minds to produce as many ideas as they can to address a problem statement in a facilitated, judgment-free environment. 

### The Design Thinking Process

One way to approach coming up with good ideas for an app is to apply the "Design Thinking" process, popularized in the UI/UX world. The Design Thinking process is iterative, flexible, and focused on collaboration between designers and users, with an emphasis on bringing ideas to life based on how real users think, feel and behave.

According to the [Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/5-stages-in-the-design-thinking-process), Design Thinking tackles complex problems by:

#### 1. Empathising: Understanding the human needs involved

The first stage of the Design Thinking process is to gain an empathic understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. This involves consulting experts to find out more about the area of concern through observing, engaging and empathizing with people to understand their experiences and motivations, as well as immersing yourself in the physical environment so you can gain a deeper personal understanding of the issues involved.

#### 2. Defining: Re-framing and defining the problem in human-centric ways

During the Define stage, you put together the information you have created and gathered during the Empathise stage. This is where you will analyse your observations and synthesise them in order to define the core problems that you and your team have identified up to this point. You should seek to define the problem as a problem statement in a human-centred manner.

To illustrate, instead of defining the problem as your own wish or a need of the company such as, “We need to increase our food-product market share among teenagers by 5%,” a much better way to define the problem would be, “Teenagers need to eat nutritious food in order to thrive, be healthy and grow.” 

#### 3. Ideating: Creating many ideas in ideation sessions

During the third stage of the Design Thinking process, designers are ready to start generating ideas. You’ve grown to understand your users and their needs in the Empathise stage, and you’ve analysed and synthesised your observations in the Define stage, and ended up with a human-centered problem statement. With this solid background, you and your team members can start to "think outside the box" to identify new solutions to the problem statement you’ve created, and you can start to look for alternative ways of viewing the problem. There are hundreds of Ideation techniques such as Brainstorm, Brainwrite, Worst Possible Idea, and SCAMPER. Brainstorm and Worst Possible Idea sessions are typically used to stimulate free thinking and to expand the problem space. It is important to get as many ideas or problem solutions as possible at the beginning of the Ideation phase. You should pick some other Ideation techniques by the end of the Ideation phase to help you investigate and test your ideas so you can find the best way to either solve a problem or provide the elements required to circumvent it.

#### 4. Prototyping: Adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping

The design team will now produce a number of inexpensive, scaled down versions of the product or specific features found within the product, so they can investigate the problem solutions generated in the previous stage. Prototypes may be shared and tested within the team itself, in other departments, or on a small group of people outside the design team. This is an experimental phase, and the aim is to identify the best possible solution for each of the problems identified during the first three stages. The solutions are implemented within the prototypes, and, one by one, they are investigated and either accepted, improved and re-examined, or rejected on the basis of the users’ experiences. By the end of this stage, the design team will have a better idea of the constraints inherent to the product and the problems that are present, and have a clearer view of how real users would behave, think, and feel when interacting with the end product.

#### 5. Testing: Developing a prototype/solution to the problem

Designers or evaluators rigorously test the complete product using the best solutions identified during the prototyping phase. This is the final stage of the 5 stage-model, but in an iterative process, the results generated during the testing phase are often used to redefine one or more problems and inform the understanding of the users, the conditions of use, how people think, behave, and feel, and to empathise. Even during this phase, alterations and refinements are made in order to rule out problem solutions and derive as deep an understanding of the product and its users as possible.

### Ideation Techniques

* **Brainstorming:** a group creativity technique by which efforts are made to find a conclusion for a specific problem by gathering a list of ideas spontaneously contributed by its members
* **Brainwriting (or the 6-3-5 Method):** is a group-structured brainstorming technique aimed at aiding innovation processes by stimulating creativity - it consists of 6 participants supervised by a moderator who are required to write down 3 ideas on a specific worksheet within 5 minutes. The outcome occurs after 6 rounds, during which participants swap their worksheets passing them on to the team member sitting at their right, is 108 ideas generated in 30 minutes
* **Worst Possible Idea:** is a Design Thinking technique where team members seek the worst solutions in ideation sessions. The “inverted” search process relaxes team members and individuals, boosts their confidence and stokes their creativity so they can examine the ideas, challenge assumptions and gain insights towards great ideas
* **The SCAMPER method:** a Design Thinking technique that can generate ideas for new products and services by encouraging you to ask seven different types of questions, which will help you understand how you can innovate and improve existing products, services, problems and ideas.

## Exercises

Break into groups of four - and on a piece of paper (or whiteboard, or Google Doc), come up with a number of ideas using at least one of the techniques listed above. Keep 5 of your favorite ideas (even if other fellows like a few of those ideas as well), then see which one of those ideas you could build on your own if you only had 14 days to do it, using only what you've learned at Pursuit over the past seven months.
