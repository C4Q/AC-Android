Android applications, as you've seen over the past 7 months, are not that hard to make - truly. Yes, clean code is important, core readability is invaluable, and the speed of your algorithms and libraries you use can make the difference between a frequently used app, and a frequently uninstalled one.

However, well-made apps just don't pop up out of thin air. They involve planning, understanding the possible users of your app, and contemplating possible solutions. In essence, they require ideation.

### "Sharpening the Saw"

Dr Steven Covey, the author of "7 Habits of Highly Effective People", describes this quote as the foundation behind his 7th effective habit:

```
Give me 8 hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first 6 in sharpening the axe (saw).
```

You'll find that with proper preparation, you'll not only be able to successfully complete assessments and coding challenges, you'll also be able to create great ideas for your own apps!

This unit, Unit 05, wil culminate in the completion of a personal solo project you'll be expected to eventually submit to the Google Play store. This means you'll have to spend a considerable amount time on your own coming up with ideas, fleshing them out, then turning them into an actual Android Application.
