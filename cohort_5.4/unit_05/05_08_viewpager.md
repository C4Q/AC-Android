# Lecture

In class, we have explored a number of list-like views in Android:
* ListView
* Menus
* Pickers
* Spinners
* Navigation Bar Menu
* RecyclerView

All of these views display lists of items on the screen, and in some cases, as in the itemview of a RecyclerView, can be quite complex. You can even display these views either horizontal, or vertical.
