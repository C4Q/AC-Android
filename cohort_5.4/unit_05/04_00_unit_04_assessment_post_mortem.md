### What is a Postmortem?

Wikipedia describes a postmortem as:

```
A project post-mortem is a process, usually performed at the conclusion of a project, to determine and analyze elements of the project that were successful or unsuccessful. Project post-mortems are intended to inform process improvements which mitigate future risks and to promote iterative best practices.
```
