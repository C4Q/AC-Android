## Warmup - DO THIS NOW!!! (15 Minutes) :fire::fire::fire:

If you had to describe your app, by boiling a description down to its intended purpose, and its most important features in under 30 seconds - how would it sound? Write a quick 30-second description of your solo project.

# Lecture

One of the requirements for your solo project involves the creation of a presentation slide deck to accompany the demo of your app in class. Your entire presentation, including your app demo, should be no longer than 5 minutes. How would you structure such a thing?

### Focus on the Basics

Remember the concept of "First Principles"? Think about what a person in the audience of an App presentation might be interested in learning the most about your app? How can you best pique their interests, and take them where you want them to go both cognitively (logical thought), and thematically (the feels and story you want to share)?

Every good slide deck should include the following slides in order:

#### 1. Title

A title slide introduces the app presentation to your audience, and should get them interested in learning more. It could be a complicated slide with complex illustrations, or it could be a clean, crisp title card with only several words of text.

#### 2. Bio

A bio (short for biography) slide is simply a slide introducing who you are, how you can be contacted (Github, LinkedIn), and perhaps an image that best captures who you feel you are as a person. Take the time to talk about your personal history as it pertains to tech - essentially your 30 second "elevator pitch", allowing the audience member to become emotionally invested in your story.

#### 3. Problem Statement

This slide should be used to describe the problem, real or perceived, which you intend to solve with your app. For example:

**In New York City, dating is hard for the young and single. The process can feel cold, the interactions intimidating, and the situations may easily become unsafe.**

Use this slide as an opportunity to share the problem in a short, but detailed way - to zone in on a problem you foundto be both frustrating, and universal.

#### 4. Currently Available Apps that Miss the Mark

A good way to answer an audience member's question before they get to ask it, would be to explore some of the current technological solutions that exist on the Google Play Store, and how they don't actually tackle the problem the way you've described it previously. For example:

**Although there are many dating apps available for download today, they don't truly solve this problem. Apps like Tinder focus too much on physical appearance, while sites like OKCupid require too much personal information from the user before making an effective match. What if there were a way to check if a person is a good partner, while also gaining the trust of a close friend?**

Use this slide as a way to throw shade on the competition, while also foreshadowing, or setting up the introduction of your apps features.

#### 5. Solution and App Features

Now for the big reveal! Describe your app, how it can solve the problem statement, and a few of the apps more unique features. For example:

**Enter: BestFriend - a Pet Play-Date app for meeting prospective dating partners! Simply make a profile with a few photos of you and your pet, and search through the profiles of other people who love pets as well. Set up a puppy playdate, and if your dog is a fan of the person you've selected, feel free to pursue a new relationship!**

This slide can inlude a bullet-pointed list of features, or a few images of your app in action. It should be used as a way to share the most important, MVP style features of what your app can provide.

#### 6. User Story

This slide should explore a day in the life of a hypothetical prospective user of your app, and how your app can help them. For example:

**Meet Abed: he is a 28 year old single person living in New York City. After using other apps to meet new people, he felt discouraged by the experiences he had swiping through questionable profiles. The only trustworthy person he knows is "Jax" - his lovable and feircely loyal German Sheppard rescue mix. "If only there were a way that Jax could help me find true love", he thought one day while opening up BestFriend - let's see how that would work....**

Tell a story that allows the audience member to stand in your user story person's shoes, and sets up the live demo of your app.

#### 7. Demo Slide

This slide can be used in many ways - some people like to share a GIF image of their app in action, while others prefer videos. However, the most effective demo card is simply a backdrop for an actual live demonstration:

**Let's make a profile for Abed, and add a few fun pics of him and Jax having a ball. Next, we'll look through the profiles of other members of the community - (swiping through some profiles) hmm, no real matches here - WAIT - this person also has a fun German Sheppard mix! Let's send this person a message to set up a play-date soon....**

The audience should now have a clear idea of what your app looks like, how it would work, and some of its more intriguing features!

**Paw-some! After the play-date, the dogs are now best friends themselves, and the owners are interested in setting up another date in the future!**

#### 8. Next Steps

No app is ever really complete - and your app is definitely NOT the exception. The app you're presenting could always use new features, so use this slide as a way to let the audience know what you'd like to add in the near future:

**Next Steps for BestFriend include: a way to use Geolocation to only find partners near a favorite dog park, a gallery for saving photos from your fun play-dates, and a social media sharing feature for sharing updates to your friends and family!**

#### 9. Closing Slide

The closing slide is often optional, but suggested. Use this slide to again share your social media links, a thank you to everyone involved in the creation of the app (or just a thank you to the people in attendance), and a call to action from the audience for questions.

## Exercises

Make a draft of a presentation for your solo project. Then the instructor will select volunteers brave enough to share their slide deck with a live demo in front of the class.
