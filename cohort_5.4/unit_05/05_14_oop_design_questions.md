## Warmup - DO THIS FIRST (15 Minutes) :fire::fire::fire:
List as many of the possible methods which can be applied to `String` objects as you can remember, i.e. `.length()`, `.contains()`, etc.

# Lecture
For today's lesson, three (3) fellows will be picked randomly to solve a design problem in under one hour in front of the class, for one of the following problems:

1. How would you design a one-player game of `Hangman` in Java?

2. How would you simulate a soda vending machine for the Java console?

3. How would you construct a note-taking app for the Java console?

4. How would you develop a two-player game of `Connect4` in Java?

5. How would you create a `Daily Planner`, for adding appointments and displaying schedules, in Java?
