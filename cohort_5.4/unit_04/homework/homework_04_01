# Pursuit Android 5.4 Homework 04.01

## Create a "Psychic Test" App

### Project Overview

Create an Android Application that allows users to test the probability of predicting a random image more than 25% of the time.

This App should have the following functionality:

* a single Main Activity page with a Frame Layout
* the Frame Layout should be used as a dynamic container for Fragment instances
* there should be three (3) fragments:
  * a Main Fragment with a spinner and a submit button
    * the spinner should let you choose the image "theme" (have at least three (3) image themes)
    * the submit button should move to a choice fragment displaying four images of a certain theme (cats, dogs, umbrellas, etc.)
  * a Choice Fragment with four (4) clickable images
    * if the image clicked matches the image randomly selected by the app, it moves to a result fragment displaying that they guessed right
    * if the image clicked does not match the image randomly selected by the app, it moves to a result fragment displaying that they guessed incorrectly
  * a Result Fragment, which displays whether the user guessed correctly or not, and also displays the percent average of right guesses over time
* EVERY SINGE GUESS should be stored in a database, as well as whether they got it right or wrong
* this app should support expected backpreess/backstack behavior

### App Requirements

This assignment is fairly open-ended, so be creative with your ideas and have fun! However, the completed submission should include each of the following requirements:
* This app MUST be made in A SINGLE ACTIVITY
* This app MUST include a SQLite Database
* All images should be stored in a drawable resource folder

### Additional Factors

- Your Psychic Test App should be able to run to completion without noticeable bugs or crashes.
- Code should be organized into methods and classes as appropriate to demonstrate good modularization and code reuse.
- All submitted code should be formatted as defined by the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

### Fun Ideas 

* Can you add an option to store guess results for different players?
* Can you support guesses for more than four (4) images?
* Can you support choices for more than three (3) image "themes"?

## Homework submission

1. Create a package called Psychic_App_HW_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME (replace LASTNAME and FIRSTNAME with your own last and first name)

2. Commit and push all work and submit your repo link using the Canvas link on the calendar by **11:59pm on FRIDAY 02/08/2019**. Submitting this assignment on time, and to completion, is expected of all participants.
