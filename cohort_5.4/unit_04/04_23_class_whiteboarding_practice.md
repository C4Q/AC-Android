What is the point of this program, "Pursuit"? The point of this program is transformation - transforming your life and career trajectory from where you were when you applied, to where you want to be by graduation. For some, this is a change in job hours and level of responsibility, for others it will be an increase in income, access to health and fiscal benefits, as well as the opportunity to make apps for a living.

To get a job in tech as a Junior Android Developer in NYC/NJ with limited to no prior experience, you'll likely need these qualifications:

- [ ] Some training (either in a school or self-taught on-your-own) in Android Development
- [ ] Experience with solving basic to intermediate DS&A Questions, either online or in-person
- [ ] The ability to "tell your story" on-command (30 second to 1 minute elevator pitch)
- [ ] The ability to answer technical and personal questions effectively and prefessionally.
- [ ] Being on-time for interviews, and always sending "thank you" emails after the interviews (and rejections), and occasionally "follow-up" emails after at least a week has passed between interviews/submissions
- [ ] Basic Git version control and Bash Knowledge
- [ ] A clearly-written one-page resume detailing your career strengths and skillset
- [ ] A one-page cover letter tailored to each job application
- [ ] A cleaned-up Github account with robust public projects (make repos with clumsy code "private")
- [ ] A fleshed-out LinkedIn profile with a number of connections, and personal recommendations
- [ ] AT LEAST ONE (1) app on the Google Play Store demonstrating knowledge of Internet conectivity, clickable RecyclerViews, image displays, user input, data persistance, clean architecture, and possibly multiple threads
- [ ] A private job tracker for following up with prospective employers (more on that later)


### But Why the Whiteboarding?

Whiteboarding... is a thing. Many companies hate them - some hiring managers love them. Max Howell, the creator of the Mac library installer "Homebrew", has some NSFW thoughts on the issue (Google it - just not here).

However, the process of whiteboarding method functions forces a developer to consider how best to approach a problem before ever writing even a single line of code. 

During a technical interview, outside of the coding challenge (completing an Android project on your own), you may be asked to either solve a problem on a whiteboard during an on-site, or share your screen remotely with an interviewer to solve a coding problem together. The latter tends to be the more frequent technique as of 2019.

Whenever approaching a new problem, it's good to consider these steps:

1. What kinds of parameters wil this method use to accept arguments?
1. What value and type is this method expected to return?
1. Identify useful variables which might be useful for storing code, or for handling edge cases
1. Write pseudocode, before writing any real code - to talk through your thought process, and explore possible solutions with your interviewer

Today, we will pick four fellows for four half-hour long whiteboarding sessions. We will randomly select four of the following six questions:

### subArray

Given start and end numbers, return a new array containing the sequence of integers from start up to but not including end, so start=5 and end=10 yields {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The end number will be greater or equal to the start number. Note that a length-0 array is valid.

```
subArray(5, 10) → [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
subArray(11, 18) → [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
subArray(1, 3) → [1, 2]
```

### zipperString

Given two strings, a and b, create a bigger string made of the first char of a, the first char of b, the second char of a, the second char of b, and so on. Any leftover chars go at the end of the result.

```
zipperString("abc", "xyz") → "axbycz"
zipperString("Hi", "There") → "HTihere"
zipperString("xxxx", "There") → "xTxhxexre"
```

### bobThere

Return true if the given string contains a "bob" string, but where the middle 'o' char can be any char.

```
bobThere("abcbob") → true
bobThere("b9b") → true
bobThere("bac") → false
```

### repeatSeparator 

Given two strings, word and a separator sep, return a big string made of count occurrences of the word, separated by the separator string.

```
repeatSeparator("Word", "X", 3) → "WordXWordXWord"
repeatSeparator("This", "And", 2) → "ThisAndThis"
repeatSeparator("This", "And", 1) → "This"
```

### sameStarChar

Returns true if for every '*' (star) in the string, if there are chars both immediately before and after the star, they are the same.

```
sameStarChar("xy*yzz") → true
sameStarChar("xy*zzz") → false
sameStarChar("*xa*az") → true
```

### blackjack

Given 2 int values greater than 0, return whichever value is nearest to 21 without going over. Return 0 if they both go over.

```
blackjack(19, 21) → 21
blackjack(21, 19) → 21
blackjack(19, 22) → 19
```
