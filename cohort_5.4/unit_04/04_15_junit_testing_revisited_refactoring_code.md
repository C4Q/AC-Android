# JUnit Testing Revisited - Refactoring Code

## Objectives
* Fellows will review the concepts related to JUnit unit testing with Android Studio
* Fellows will refactor code based on the expectations associated with each method's comments, and pre-existing unit tests
* Fellows will add new tests to the testing suite, based on the expectations set by each method's associated comments
* Fellows will refactor the code within all methods until all tests pass

# Lecture

JUnit 4 Testing involves the use of annotations and assert methods to setup, run, and confirm that all tests either pass or fail.

For today's lesson, we will imagine that we are brought in to refactor code for an app that was poorly written by a third-party developer. Your tasks will be as follows:

* Running the tests to see which ones either pass or fail
* Refactoring methods so that they do what their documentation states they do
* Run tests and refactor the methods (NOT THE TESTS) until the tests pass
* Add new tests to test the remainder of the methods, based on the expectations set for them in each method's comments
* Refactor each method until each new test passes

Download [this project here](), and modify it's code until each old and new test passes, based on the correct assumptions set forth by the docs.
