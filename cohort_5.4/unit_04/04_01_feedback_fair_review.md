# Lecture
This morning, each fellow was asked to work as a part of a group with a coding volunteer to complete a certain number of tasks required to make an Android Studio Project operational. Although it may have seemed like a stressful experience, the practice of taking a broken project, and making it work, is a common interview step for many companies, outside of a typical coding challenge.

Today, we will break down every step, and work on identifying each of the bugs found in the project, as well as how to add the necessary features required for a working app.

The tasks are as follows:

MainActivity: 
- [ ] Add MainActivity to manifest (Bug Fix)
- [ ] Add a recyclerview to activity_main.xml

- [ ] Else make retrofit call and get a dog image (TODO)
- [ ] Add this image url to sharedpreferences with the key “breed_name + image” 
- [ ] Then send and start Display Activity 

activity_main.xml:
- [ ] Add RecyclerView widget (Bug fix)
- [ ] Set values to layout_width and layout_height of RecyclerView to fill up entire screen (Bug fix)

breed_itemview.xml:
- [ ] Add a TextView inside CardView  (TODO)
