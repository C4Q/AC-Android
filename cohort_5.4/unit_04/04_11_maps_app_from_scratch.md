# Lecture

Today we will build an "App From Scratch", for time. The goal of today's lesson is to create an app with a Fragment containing a RecyclerView with a list of addresses, then move to another Activity/Fragment displaying the clicked address  as a point on a Map. The steps are as follows: 
* Connect to JSON endpoint using Retrofit
* Display list within a RecyclerView
* Display a RecyclerView within a Fragment
* Pass data with a click event BACK TO the MainActivity
* Send an intent with data to the Map Activity
* Display that data as a marker on a Map

The JSON Endpoint we will be working with today [can be found here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JDVila/storybook/master/museums.json). First you will be asked to complete a task within a certain block of time. Then, once the time alloted has ended, a fellow will be randomly selected by the instructor, and asked to complete the task in front of the class.

We are tasked to complete this challenge within 3 (three) hours.

The tasks are as follows:
### Open a new Android Studio Project (5 Minutes)
Open up a new Android Studio Project, using an Empty Activity

### Make data model class(es) based on the JSON Endpoint (10 Minutes)
Evaluate the JSON, then form one or more data model classes based on the JSON

### Create Singleton Class for Retrofit Instance (10 Minutes)
Create a Singleton class using the Static Factory Method design pattern, to contain a unique single instance of the Retrofit class.

### Create Retrofit Service Interface (15 Minutes)
Create an Interface for a Retrofit service, adding methods for creating get requests that include the path that comes after the base url.

### Make a Retrofit Get Request, then use the Response (15 Minutes)
Make a request to the JSON endpoint, then receive the data from the response body.

### Make a Fragment within the MainActivity
Host a Fragment within the MainActivity, with both a static factory method, and interface callbacks.

### Subclass a RecyclerView ViewHolder Class, with corresponding ItemView XML Layout (15 Minutes)
Create a ViewHolder class, which references the views declared in an ItemView XML Layout.

### Subclass a RecyclerView Adapter Class (15 Minutes)
Create an Adapter class, which overrides all inherited methods, and binds the list data passed to it to the appropriate views as needed.

### Add a RecyclerView that fills the screen of the Fragment, and populate it with data from the Retrofit `onResponse()` callback (10 Minutes)
Add a RecyclerView to your Fragment, then pass a list of data to it, the list received from the Retrofit Response.

### Make a Maps Activity (10 Minutes)
Make a new activity that contains a Map.

### When a List Tile is clicked, it should pass data to the MainActivity via Interface Callback (15 Minutes)
Make the itemview clickable, then communicate the address selected back to the Activity.

### Display the Address as a marker on the Map (20 Minutes)
Send the name and address from the Fragment, send the intent to the Map Activity, and display the marker with the name of the address on the Map.
