# Lecture

### Activities
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to make their own activity classes that inherit from AppCompatActivity, and add a corresponding XML Layout File. Fellows are expected to override Activity Lifecycle callback methods as necessary.

### Intents
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to create explicit intents to move between their own app's activities. Fellows are expected to be able to pass intent extras between activities, and access this data in new activities. Fellows are expected to be able to sent implicit intents to open other external applications, and share data using intent extras between applications.

### Resources
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to add all hardcoded values to resources files within the values folder. Fellows are expected to be able to reference String resouces directly in Java classes, and access them as necessary.

### Shared Preferences
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to add data to the Shared Preferences file for their application, using the application's context, and retreive data from the Shared Preferences file, using key/value pairs.

### Android Manifest
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to add internet permissions to the Android Manifest, as well as parent activity names to child activities to aid in effective activity backstack navigation.

### Gradle Dependencies
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to add library dependencies in gradle, by adding them directly to `build.gradle` files, or by utilizing the `Project Structure` menu option in the Android Studio IDE.

### Data Model POJO's and JSON
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to interpret human-readable JSON text, and create data model classes based on the objects represented by the JSON data. 

### RetroFit and JSON
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to connect to a JSON endpoint using the Retrofit API and GSON, and use the data returned in the `onResponse()` callback method.

### RecyclerView
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to utilize the RecyclerView API implement their own Adapter and ViewHolder classes, pass a list of data to the adapter, and manage the layout of the RecyclerView implementation. Fellows are also expected to handle click events for each RecyclerView itemview.

### Picasso
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to utilize the Picasso API to pass in String Web URLs to Picasso, and pass images into ImageView instances. 

### Fragments
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to subclass the Fragment class, and make their own fragments. Fellows are expected to inflate and swap fragments using a container layout within a host activity's layout. Fellows are expected to create static factory methods for their subclassed fragments to pass data from the activity to the fragments. Fellows are expected to communicate events and send data from fragments to their hosting activity using the listener pattern.
