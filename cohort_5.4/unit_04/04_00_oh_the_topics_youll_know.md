With every life-changing journey, it's easy to look at results and assume that no real change has occured, or you're not in a place where you thought you'd be after a certain period of time. However, although results are very important, it's good to look back at all you've learned, as well as all you've atempted in the last 6 months:

Use this list as a checklist to scratch off all the topics you feel you are pretty good at, and a guide for all the topics you feel you'd like to review a bit more. Later units will either review past topics, or cover more advanced topics that junior developers aren't necessarily expected to know prior to starting with a company - so if you see anything on this list that you feel you should exlpore a bit more, share those topics with your mentors, volunteers, as well as any other member of the instructional staff. You have all learned a great deal, and attempted even more than you may think! Let's keep it going!
