# Pursuit Android 5.4 Homework 02.02

## Create a "Group Portfolio" App

### Project overview

Create an Android Application that allows users to explore the portfolios of each member of a group.

This App should have the following functionality:

* a Main Activity page describing the goal of the application, and a group photo, from the drawable folder
* a Navigation Button in the toolbar/actionbar that, when clicked, displays a navigation drawer that allows the user to choose the biography page of each team member
* an Activity for each team member, displaying: 
  * an image of that particular team member, from the drawable folder
  * a brief biography within a `ScrollView`
  * a popup menu in the toolbar/actionbar for 3 (three) Github projects created by that team member that, when clicked, redirects to an external web browser app displaying that particular Github link to the screen
  * a navigation back arrow on the toolbar/actionbar allowing the user to jump back to the main activity

### App Requirements

This assignment is fairly open-ended, so be creative with your ideas and have fun! However, the completed submission should include each of the following requirements:
* All Biography Activities should have a parent activity declared for it in the `AndroidManifest.XML` file
* All String values, View Dimensions, Color Values should be stored in their corresponding values XML files as necessary
* All Activity view values should account for Orientation changes (`onSavedInstanceState`, different layouts for Portrait/Landscape, or Locked Orienation)
* All Activity Layout Root Views should be a `ConstraintLayout`

### Group Requirements

* Although all team members are required to submit code, in addition to the app work, each member will choose a job title for the group, and complete a specific responsibility:
  * Tech Lead: responsible for creating a remote Github repo, and merging feature branches
  * Project Manager: responsible for recording/assigning tasks, and managing the team's Trello Board
  * Design Lead: responsible for choosing/formatting images, and designing layouts on storyboards prior to code composition
  * Demo Lead: responsible for creating a presentation deck in Google Slides, for a 5 (five) minute long presentation to the cohort
* Each team member is responsible for their own biography activity, which should be made on their own feature branch, then pushed to Github with a pull request to the master branch

### Additional Factors

- Your Group Portfolio App should be able to run to completion without noticeable bugs or crashes.
- Code should be organized into methods and classes as appropriate to demonstrate good modularization and code reuse.
- All submitted code should be formatted as defined by the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

This is a GROUP ASSIGNMENT, so each student will be responsible for their individual job title tasks, AND contribute an EQUAL AMOUNT OF CODE when working with their other teammates.

### Fun Ideas 

* Can you make a "Twitter" link for each biography activity?
* Can you support biographies in other Spoken Languages?
* Can each biography `Activity` have a button that allows the user to Email each team member directly?

## Homework submission

1. Create a package called Group_Portfolio_HW_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME (replace `LASTNAME` and `FIRSTNAME` with your own last and first name)

2. Commit and push all work and submit your repo link using the Canvas link on the calendar by **11:59pm on FRIDAY 12/14/2018**. Submitting this assignment on time, and to completion, is expected of all participants.
