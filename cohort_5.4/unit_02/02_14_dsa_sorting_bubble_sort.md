## What we know so far

* Now lets see how these methods work 

## Analysis of Algorithims 
* We're studying computer program performance and resource usage 
* What can be more important than performance?

    |               |               |       |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | modularity    | reliability | robustness |
    | correctness   | simplicity      |   extensibility |
    | maintainability | user-friendliness      |  programmer time |

* When we study performance we want to understand the scalibility of    algorithim 
* Peformance will draw the line between what is feasible and what is impossible 

## The Sorting Problem 
* Input: Sequence {a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, a<sub>4</sub>...  a<sub>n</sub>} of numbers 
* Output: Permutation {a'<sub>1</sub>, a'<sub>2</sub>, a'<sub>3</sub>, a'<sub>4</sub>...  a'<sub>n</sub>} of numbers 
    * Example:<br />
        Input: {8, 2, 4, 9, 3, 6}<br />
        Output: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
        
## Bubble Sort Definition   
*  A bubble sort algorithim walks through (iterates) through some collection and compares two elements at a time
* If the elements are out of order it swaps them 
* It will continue to swap out of order elements until the entire collection is sorted 
* Lets sort the int[] arr = {9, 7, 4, 1, 2}

<img align= "left" hspace="20" src="https://i.imgur.com/v4rSd0Z.png">

* We start by comparing the first two elements 9 and 7 and since theyre out of order swap 
* Next compare the second and third elements 9 and 4. Since 9 is bigger than 4 it should come after, So we swap the two elements as well 
* The next two elements are 9 and 1. Again 9 should come after 1, another swap will take place
* Finally 9 and 2 are the last two elements of the first iteration. The number 2 should come before 9 so swap these two elements.
* Great We've Completed the first iteration of our bubble sort but out list isn't sorted yet!
* We will need to continue to repeat this process for each of the remaining elements until our collection is confirmed to be sorted 
* Question is now, How many times will we have to iterate through the collection in order to 
* Lets see if we can notice a patter 

   |       2 Elements        |    3 Elemenets           |  4 Elements     |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | [9 , 7]    | [9, 7, 4] |  [9, 7, 4, 1] |
    | [7 , 9]   |[7, 4, 9]     |    [7, 4, 1, 9] |
    | Ordered! | [4, 7, 9]        |  [4, 1, 7, 9] |
    |  | Ordered!       |  [1, 4, 7, 9] |
    |  |      |  Ordered! |

* Generalization 
    * Given a collection of n unsorted elements it takes (n - 1) iterations through the list in order to sort using the bubble sort algorithim

## Optimization
* Lets try to catch another pattern in the bubble sort 
<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wHgKpB6.png">
<br />
* Note we didnt need to compare or check the last element because we already know that it already has the correct number 9
* For the next iteration we wouldnt have to check 7 or the number 9 since they are already in their correct positions so
    * After 2 iterations of bubble sort checking the last two spots in the array is unnecessary
    * This can keep going if After 3 iterations through the array we dont need to check the last 3 elements 
* Generelaztion 
    * After X iterations checking the last x elements in a collection is unnecessary

* Optimizing like this allows us to save time and memory if we can break out of some action early

* Bubble sort
    * A single iteration through a collection puts one element in the correct location.
    * It will take n-1 passes through a collection (n is the number of elements) to sort the collection

```java 
private static void bubbleSort(int[] inputArr) {

    boolean isSorted = false;

    while (!isSorted) {
      isSorted = true;
      for (int index = 1; index < inputArr.length; index++) {
        System.out.println("Comparing: " + inputArr[index] + " and " + inputArr[index - 1]);

        if (inputArr[index - 1] > inputArr[index]) {
          isSorted = false;
          System.out.println("SWAP: " + inputArr[index] + " and " + inputArr[index - 1]);
          int temp = inputArr[index - 1];
          inputArr[index - 1] = inputArr[index];
          inputArr[index] = temp;
        }
        System.out.println("Array is now " + Arrays.toString(inputArr));
      }
      System.out.println("One full pass through the array complete");
      System.out.println("Is the array sorted? " + isSorted);
    }
  } 
```

* Even though the code has been optimized our 
* If the bubble sort is bad, then just how bad is it?
    * If we have to n number of iterations through our array 
    * And if each iteration has to check all n elements in the array 
    Multiplication gives us n * n = n<sup>2</sup>  Quadratic runtime or O(n<sup>2</sup>)
    * If our collection doubled in size the amount of time it would take would quadruple
    * But it doesnt take more than O(1) memory so its useful in sorting small collections 

    * Some Final Stats
