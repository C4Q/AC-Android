* Fellows will review the topics covered in the Unit 02 Assessment

# Lecture

### Activities
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to make their own activity classes that inherit from AppCompatActivity, and add a corresponding XML Layout File. Fellows are expected to override Activity Lifecycle callback methods as necessary.

### Views
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to add views, and manipulate the properties of these views within XML layout files. Fellows are expected to be able to reference these views in their activities directly using Java code, and extract the data within them as necessary. These views include, but are not limited to:
* ConstraintLayout
* TextView
* EditText
* Button
* ImageView

### Intents
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to create both explicit intents to move between their own app's activities, but also implicit intents to open other applications, using appropriate flags. Fellows are expected to be able to pass intent extras between activities, and access this data in new activities.

### Orientation Changes
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to account for orientation changes within their apps by utilizing onSavedInstanceState, adding id's to views in XML, and adding orientation specific resources as necessary.

### Resources
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to add all hardcoded values to resources files within the values folder. Fellows are expected to be able to add drawable resources to the drawable folder, and access them as necessary.

### Android Manifest
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to add permissions to the Android Manifest, as well as parent activity names to child activities to aid in effective activity backstack navigation.

### Menus and Pickers
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to understand how to manipulate values within menus and pickers, and account for click events whenever these views are selected.

### JUnit Testing
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to understand the purpose of unit tests in Java and Android, how to set up a testing environment, how to create their own tests, and how to add assert methods to these tests to evaluate the effectiveness of methods and classes.
