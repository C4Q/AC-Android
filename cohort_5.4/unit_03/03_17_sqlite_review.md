## Warm-Up - DO THIS FIRST!!! (15 Minutes)
Review yesterday's lesson on SQLiteOpenHelper, and think about the kinds of queries we could write based on the data from both JSON endpoints found in the [DogBreeds Project](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Android/blob/master/cohort_5.4/unit_03/projects/DogBreeds.zip) from an earlier lesson.

# Lecture

Thus far, we've learned how to pull data from the internet, parse that data, turn it into Java objects, then display the objects' data in a RecyclerView. We even learned how to cache that data in a very basic way using Shared Preferences.
In today's lesson, we will use the project [DogBreeds](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Android/blob/master/cohort_5.4/unit_03/projects/DogBreeds.zip), to show how we can add a SQLite database to our existing projects, and store data for offline use.
