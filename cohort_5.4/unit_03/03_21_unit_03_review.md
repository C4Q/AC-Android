### Shared Preferences
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to add data to the Shared Preferences file for their application, using the application's context, and retreive data from the Shared Preferences file, using key/value pairs.

### Android Manifest
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to add internet permissions to the Android Manifest, as well as parent activity names to child activities to aid in effective activity backstack navigation.

### Gradle Dependencies
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to add library dependencies in gradle, by adding them directly to `build.gradle` files, or by utilizing the `Project Structure` menu option in the Android Studio IDE.

### Data Model POJO's and JSON
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to interpret human-readable JSON text, and create data model classes based on the objects represented by the JSON data. 

### RetroFit and JSON
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to be able to connect to a JSON endpoint using the Retrofit API and GSON, and use the data returned in the `onResponse()` callback method.

### RecyclerView
**Expectations:** Fellows are expected to utilize the RecyclerView API implement their own Adapter and ViewHolder classes, pass a list of data to the adapter, and manage the layout of the RecyclerView implementation. Fellows are also expected to handle click events for each RecyclerView itemview.

### Picasso
**Expectations** Fellows are expected to utilize the Picasso API to pass in String Web URLs to Picasso, and pass images into ImageView instances.
