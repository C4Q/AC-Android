### Primitive Data Types
There are 8 (eight) primitive data types in Java:
* `byte`
* `short`
* `int`
* `long`
* `float`
* `double`
* `char`
* `boolean`

All primitive data types are written in lower case.

### Variable Assignment

Variables can hold either values, or references to objects in memory, depending on their static type. When we declare a variable named `number` of type `int`, we may do the following:

|type|variable name|
|:-:|:-:|
|int|number|
