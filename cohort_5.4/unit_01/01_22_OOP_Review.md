### Primitive Data Types
There are 8 (eight) primitive data types in Java:
* `byte`
* `short`
* `int`
* `long`
* `float`
* `double`
* `char`
* `boolean`

All primitive data types are written in lower case.

* `char` and `int` values are effectively interchangeable up to a certain value
* integer division rounds down the value of dividing two whole numbers by each other


### Variable Assignment

Variables can hold either values, or references to objects in memory, depending on their static type. When we declare a variable named `number` of type `int`, we may do the following:

|type|variable name|
|:-:|:-:|
|int|number;|

If we were to print the contents of this value to the screen, we would get an error, because **it is not initialized**. We should assign it a value before we can make any real use of it.

Assignment requires an `=` operator, where we assign a value on the right of the `=`, to a variable of the appropriate data type on the left:

|type|variable name|assignment|value|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|int|number|=|25;|

When a value or reference has been assigned to a variable, we say that **it has been initialized**.

### Comparison Operators

When comparing numerical values, we can use the following operators:

|operator|name|
|:-:|:-:|
|==|equals to|
|>|greater than|
|<|less than|
|>=|greater than or equal to|
|<=|less than or equal to|
|!=|not equal to|

Numerical comparisons result to true/false, or boolean values.

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used in logical expressions, i.e. - when comparing 1 or more boolean values, or expressions that resolve to boolean values:

|operator|name|
|:-:|:-:|
|&&|AND|
|\|\||OR|
|!|NOT|

`&&` expressions evaluate to `true` if ALL values compared are `true`. Otherwise, they evaluate to `false`.

`||` expressions evaluate to `true` if AT LEAST ONE of the values compared are `true`.

`!` expressions evaluate to the opposite boolean value to the original value given.

### Control Structures

Control Structures redirect the flow of a program's execution based on certain conditions:

```java
if(true) {
  doThisThing();
}
```

You can use an if/else code block to direct a program's flow of execution even further:

```java
if(true) {
  doThisThing();
} else {
  doThatOtherThing();
}
```

If more than one condition needs to be evaluated, you might want to use an if/else if control block:

```java
if(true) {
  doThisThing();
} else if(true){
  doThatOtherThing();
} else {
  doSomethingElseEntirely();
}
```

You can compose a `switch` statement if you want to direct flow based on the value of a variable:

```java
char letter = 'B';
    switch (letter) {
      case 'A':
            System.out.println('A');
            break;
      case 'B':
            System.out.println('B');
            break;
      case 'C':
            System.out.println('C');
            break;
      default:
            System.out.println("Does not compute!");
            break;
    }
```

`break` statements are necessary for breaking out of the switch statement once a case has been met.

Ternary operators can be used to assign variables to values based on certain conditions as well:

```java
String greeting = time < 12 ? "Good Morning! : "Good Afternoon";

```

### Loops

There are 4 (four) loops we've discussed so far:
* while loop
* do-while loop
* for loop
* for-each loop

**While Loop:**

Do a thing as long as a condition evaluates to `true`:

```java
while(number < 10) {
  doThisThing();
  number--;
}
```

**Do-While Loop:**

Do a thing at least once whether the while condition is true or not, then do it again as long as a while condition evaluates to `true`:

```java
do {
  doThisThing();
  number--;
} while(number < 10);
```

**For Loop:**

Set a value for a counter variable, do a thing a certain number of times, as long as a condition evaluates to `true`, and also change the value of a counter variable with each iteration of a loop:

```java
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  System.out.println("This loop: " + i);
}
```
