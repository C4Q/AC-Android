As we explored last week, there are two main types of coding challenges:

* complete an app from scratch
* complete an algorithm using a data structure of some sort on a whiteboard or on a screenshare

Today, we will explore some of the simplest whiteboarding questions you may ever encounter: String Manipulations.

### How can we manipulate a `String`?

`String` objects are immutable. This means that although you can reassign a variable of type `String` with a new `String` object, you won't actually be able to change the previous String, only replace it. However, the concept of String manipulation usually describes the action of taking a `String` parameter, and returning a variation of that parameter, based on certain requirements.

Remember this question from our first Homework Assignemnt?

**01.01.06 string-elide**

>Write a method called elide that takes a String parameter. For longer strings, the method returns a new string constructed out of the first three letters of the argument, followed by three periods ("..."), followed by the last letter of the argument.
>
>However, if the resulting string is not shorter than the argument, the method should return the argument instead.
>
>For example,
>
>elide("Hello!")               // returns "Hello!"
>elide("Hello, world!")        // returns "Hel...!"
>elide("That's not my name.")  // returns "Tha...."
>
>Remember that String.substring() can take two arguments: the start index and the end index.

Let's break down this question to see exactly what it's asking of us:
* Write a method that accepts a `String` as a parameter
* It should return a `String` value
* If a `String` parameter value is "too long", return the first 3 letters, then three dots, then the last char

So, those are given requirements. However, there are some inferred ones as well, for example:
* How long a `String` is too long a `String`?
* What is `String.substring()`, and how does that work?

Well, the first one is actually answered for us:
> if the resulting string is not shorter than the argument, the method should return the argument instead.

How do we know what that would be? If we pass in the `String` "1234567", using the given instructions, we'd get the string:

```
123...7
```

But guess what? That `String` is **equal** in length to the original input, **not less**, so we'd actually have to return the original value, which in this case is `1234567`. This means that if the `String` parameter length is less than or equal to 7, return the parameter unchanged. If its length is greater than 7, modify the `String`, and return a new `String` parameter with the the first 3 original letters, 3 dots, and the final character as one `String`.

Now, how can `String.substring()` help us in this situation?

When the method `substring()` is called on an object of type `String`, it returns a shorter version of the original `String` object, based on what parameters are passed into the `substring()` method.

The method `substring()` is an **Overloaded** method in the `String` class, meaning there are several methods with that same method signature, and are differentiated between each other based on the number, type, and order of its parameters. 

The method `substring()` takes in indices of chars within a string - one of its several methods takes in 1 (one) index, another takes in 2 (two). The method that takes only one index as a parameter, takes the string it is called on, and returns a new string with every char from the index passed into the `.substring()` method, up until the end of the string. For example:

```java
String name = "Apollo Creed";
name.substring(5);
```
should return the `String` value:

```
o Creed
```

Essentially, return a new `String` consisting of the `char` at index 5 of the `String` `name`, and every `char` after that until the end of the `String`.

The method that takes two indices as parameters, takes the string it is called on, and returns a new string with every char from the index passed into the `.substring()` method, up until the `char` at the index RIGHT BEFORE the index passed to the second parameter. For example:

```java
String name = "Apollo Creed";
name.substring(0, 5);
```
should return the `String` value:

```
Apoll
```

So, how can we use this to our advantage? Let's create the method together:

```java
public static String elide(String s) {
String result = "";
  if(s.length() <= 7) {
    return s;
  } else {
  result = s.substring(0, 3) + "..." + s.substring(s.length() - 1);
  }
return result;
}
```
We could actually cut this down even more:
```java
public static String elide(String s) {
  if(s.length() <= 7) {
    return s;
  }
  return s.substring(0, 3) + "..." + s.substring(s.length()-1);
}
```
Awesome! We just reduced the code necessary by two lines! But we can make this even shorter, using a ternary operator expression:

```java
public static String elide(String s) {
  return s.length() <= 7 ? s : s.substring(0, 3) + "..." + s.substring(s.length()-1);
}
```

Look at that! The entire method, with just one line of code! We don't have to store any values, just return immediately with certain values, if certain conditions are met!

Concatenation is great - but it can be an expensive use of memory for the computer. It's not a big deal if you're using just one line of concatenation, but if you are looping through a string, this can get costly.

Enter: the `StringBuilder` class!

Let's say we're asked to make a method that turns a `char` array into a `String`:

```java
public static String charArrayToString(char[] array) {
  String result = "";
  for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    result = result + array[i]; 
  }
  return result;
}
```

This is expensive because we are constantly clearing and reassigning a new value to the same variable, thereby creating multiple instances of the `String` class in memory, waiting to be garbage collected. However, when using a `StringBuilder` object, we don't actually create a `String` until the very last moment:

```java
public static String charArrayToString(char[] array) {
  StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
  for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    result.append(array[i]); 
  }
  return result.toString();
}
```

The `StringBuilder` class has a few helper methods that can save a lot of time in algorithms. Remember how to reverse a `String` object?

```java
public static String reverseMe(String input) {
  String result = "";
  for(int i = input.length()-1; i <= 0; i--) {
    result = result + input.charAt(i);
  }
  return result;
}
```
That works, but it requires you creating a loop to iterate through the string input in reverse. You can instead do this with the `StringBuilder` class:

```java
public static String reverseMe(String input) {
  StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder().append(input);
  return result.reverse().toString();
}
```

You could even reduce the code even further by adding more method chaining:

```java
public static String reverseMe(String input) {
  return new StringBuilder().append(input).reverse().toString();
}
```

Not everything you create needs to be assigned to a variable before it can be used - with method chaining, you're allowed to interact with an object immediately after it has been created, and add more functionality as necessary - you can even return a value once the task has completed!

Here are a few additional methods for working with Strings:

|Method|Use Case|
|:-:|---|
|.substring()|allows you to copy and return a range of chars from a String|
|.charAt()|allows you to retreive a particular char in a String at a certain index|
|.length()|allows you to find out the number of chars in a String|
|.charAt(length()-1)|allows you to retreive the last char in a String|
|String.valueOf()|allows you to convert primitives to Strings|
|StringBuilder()|allows you to manipulate a String before it is created|
|new StringBuilder().append()|allows you to append chars and Strings to a StringBuilder object|
|new StringBuilder().reverse()|allows you to reverse the order of chars in a StringBuilder object|
|new StringBuilder().toString()|allows you to return a completed String object as needed|
