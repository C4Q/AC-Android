# Pursuit Android 5.4 Homework 01.03

## Write a "Bank Teller" Program

### Project overview

Write a command line tool for a Bank that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete customers and their bank accounts.

This program should have the following funtionality:

* Require that a user (Bank Teller) sign-in with a pre-determined Username and Password
* Allow a user to list all of the current customers for your bank
* Allow a user to add new customers
* Allow a user to list all of the bank accounts for each user of the bank
* Allow a user to add new bank accounts
* Allow a user to view and update the account balances for every user
* Allow a user to withdraw an amount of money, or close an entire account
* Allow a user to delete a customer, and all their data
* Allow a user to sign out of the program

**Note:**

* Upon sign-in, the system should already have 5 customers in the data structure
* Each customer should have at least 1 (one) account
* Each account should have a current balance
* When the Bank Teller signs out, and signs back in - the account data should return to their pre-set values 

### Requirements

This assignment is fairly open-ended, so be creative with your game ideas and have fun! However, the completed submission should include each of the following requirements:

* Accept input from the user with a `Scanner` object
* At least one `Array`
* At least one `ArrayList`
* At least one `HashMap`
* At least one `HashSet`
* All of the above should exist in methods
* At least one `class`

### Additional Factors

- Your game should be able to run to completion without noticeable bugs or crashes.
- Code should be organized into methods and classes as appropriate to demonstrate good modularization and code reuse.
- All submitted code should be formatted as defined by the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

This is an individual assignment, so each student will be responsible for submitting their own original game.

### Fun Ideas 

* Make a Logo for your Bank
* Can you make "Secret Accounts", that only those with a High Clearance can see?

## Homework submission

1. Create a package called Java_Bank_Pursuit_HW_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME (replace `LASTNAME` and `FIRSTNAME` with your own last and first name)

2. Commit and push all work and submit your repo link using the Canvas link on the calendar by **8pm on Saturday 11/10/2018**. Submitting this assignment in on time, and to completion, is expected of all participants.
