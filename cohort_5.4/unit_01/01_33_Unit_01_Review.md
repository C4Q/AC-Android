# Lecture

### Primitive Types
**Expectations:** Fellows should be able to tell the difference between, and use cases for, all primitive types. Fellows should be able to autobox primitive types to their object wrapper class counterparts.

### Integer Division vs. Double Division
**Expectations:** Fellows should be able to tell the difference between, and use cases for, the division of `int` values and the division of `double` values.

### Method and Constructor Overloading
**Expectations:** Fellows should be able to tell the difference between, and use cases for, methods with the same name and return type, but different number, type, and order of parameters.

### Static Type Fields and Return Values for Methods
**Expectations:** Fellows should be able to tell the difference between, and use cases for, static fields and methods, and how they are accessed from outside a class. Fellows should be able to create static constant fields using the `final` keyword.

### Interfaces and Abstract Classes
**Expectations:** Fellows should be able to tell the difference between, and use cases for, interfaces and abstract classes with abstract method signatures.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
**Expectations:** Fellows should be able to tell the difference between, and use cases for, data structures like Arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps, and HashSets. Fellows should be able to create basic algorithms for traversing these data structures to solve elementary problems using loops in linear and constant time.

### Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
**Expectations:** Fellows should be able to tell the difference between, and use cases for, creating classes with instance fields and methods representing real-world objects. Fellows should be able to create concrete classes that inherit from parent classes, override parent methods, use a super's constructor, and compose fields and methods that are unique to child classes.
