#### 01.27.01

Compose a method called `sumTheArray` that, given an int[] array, returns the sum of all elements combined. For example:

The method call:
```java
sumTheArray(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5});
```

should return:

```
15
```

#### 01.27.02

Compose a method called `sumEvenIndexedArray` that, given an int[] array, returns the sum of all elements found at even-numbered indices combined. For example:

The method call:
```java
sumEvenIndexedArray(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5});
```

should return:

```
9
```

#### 01.27.03

Compose a method called `findSecondLargest` that, given an int[] array, returns the second-largest element in the array. For example:

The method call:
```java
sumTheArray(new int[]{2, 9, 5, 8, 4});
```

should return:

```
8
```

Copy and paste the code you wrote below.

#### 01.27.04

Compose a method called `findElement` that, given an int[] array, returns whether an element exists in the array, with the least amount of steps, regardless of the array's length. For example:

The method call:
```java
findElement(new int[]{2, 9, 5, 8, 4}, 4);
```

should return:

```
true
```
