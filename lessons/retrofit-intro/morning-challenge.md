# Morning Challenge :octopus:

1) Create a new Android Studio project:

- Use the **Application name** `Retrofit Chuck Norris`
- Use the **Company domain** `yourname.c4q.nyc`
- Set the **Project location** to your `~/Desktop/accesscode` directory.
- On the next screen, select **Phone and Tablet** and set the **Minimum SDK** at API 19.
- On the next screen, select **Empty Activity** to initialize your project with an empty activity. Continue to the next screen and name it `ChuckNorrisActivity` and keep **Generate Layout File** checked.
- Click **Finish** to create your project.

2) In your `activity_chuck_norris.xml`, place a single `TextView` with its width and height set to `match_parent` and gravity set to `center`. Assign it the id `@+id/tv_chuck`. Set the text size to `36sp`. Set the default text to `"Chuck Norris"`.

3) In your `ChuckNorrisActivity.java` file, use `findViewById(int id)` to store a reference to the `TextView` in a field named `chuckTV`.

4) Once you have finished, build the project and deploy it to your device or emulator.
