# Morning Challenge :hatching_chick:

You have two eggs, and access to a one-hundred story building. Both eggs are identical. 

The aim is to find out **the highest floor** from which an egg will not break when dropped out of a window from that floor. If an egg is dropped and does not break, it is undamaged and can be dropped again. However, once an egg is broken, thatâ€™s it for that egg.

If an egg breaks when dropped from floor `n`, then it would also have broken from any floor above that. If an egg survives a fall, then it will survive any fall shorter than that.

**The question is: *What strategy should you adopt to minimize the number egg drops it takes to find the highest floor?***
