# Morning challenge

# NO LAPTOPS

Write an algorithm that checks to see if a string has the same count of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string may contain any Unicode character -- not just 'x's and 'o's -- and may be of any length.

What is the worst-case runtime complexity of your algorithm, expressed in Big-O notation?

Be ready to describe your solution to the class at 10:20.
