# Exercises

### The parameter `weekday` is `true` if it is a weekday, and the parameter `vacation` is `true` if we are on vacation. We sleep in if it is not a weekday or we're on vacation. Return `true` if we sleep in.

### Given a string, take the last `char` and return a new string with the last `char` added at the front and back, so "cat" yields "tcatt". The original string will be length 1 or more.

### Given two non-negative `int` values, return `true` if they have the same last digit, such as with 27 and 57. 

### Given an `int[]`, we'll say that a triple is a value appearing 3 times in a row in the array. Return `true` if the array does not contain any triples.

### This is slightly more difficult version of the famous FizzBuzz problem which is sometimes given as a first problem for job interviews. Consider the series of numbers beginning at start and running up to but not including end, so for example `start = 1` and `end = 5` gives the series 1, 2, 3, 4. Return a new `String[]` array containing the string form of these numbers (e.g. `["1", "2", "3" "4"]`), except for multiples of 3, use "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5 use "Buzz", and for multiples of both 3 and 5 use "FizzBuzz". In Java, `String.valueOf(xxx)` will make the `String` form of an `int` or other type. This version is a little more complicated than the usual version since you have to allocate and index into an array instead of just printing, and we vary the start/end instead of just always doing 1..100.

### Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is an anagram of the other.

### Given an `int[]`, return the number of even integers in the array. 

### Given a non-empty `int[]`, return `true` if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side.

### Implement a method to preform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string `aabcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume that the string only has upper and lowercase letters (a - z).

### Given an array of non-empty strings, return a `Map<String, String>` with a key for every different first character seen, with the value of all the strings starting with that character appended together in the order they appear in the array.

### Given an array of strings, return a `Map<String, Boolean>` where each different string is a key and its value is true if that string appears 2 or more times in the array.

### Given a sorted `int[]` and an `int` value, write an algorithm to determine if the input array contains the value.
